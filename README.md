## Music Reports Web Development Test

**Step 1:**
Create a react project using either create react app or webpack

Here I used create-react-app

**Step 2:**
Create 2 pages using hooks to navigate between them

Here I used React Router v6 with, I navigating between pages with useNavaigate();

**Step 3:**
Add a form with at least one input and a table to each page

I have added a search input to each page

**Step 4:**
Add data to the tables using an ajax call. If you have an existing dataset you can use it.

Here I used the Fetch API to get data from this data set.
Data Source - https://dummyjson.com/products

**Step 5:**
Create a filter/search for each table using useEffect/useState to trigger from the input on the same page

Here I wrote a function that checks if the search input is empty, and if so it shows all the data, else it will filter the products according to the search input.

**Step 6:**
Using context maintain the filters on each page when navigating back and forth.

**Step 7:**
Post your code on your github.
